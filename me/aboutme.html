			<h1>About me</h1>
				I am Azores Czar Buslon Daguplo also known as Juris. My friends call me Juris because they can't pronounce my real name properly. <br><br>
				I was born on March 31 , 1998. My parents are Saturnino Daguplo Jr. and Leonisa Daguplo. My older sister is Auriluz Uaia Daguplo and our youngest brother is Abdiel Czar Daguplo. I grow up in Sierra Bullones Bohol, and now currently living in Booy District Tagbilaran City, Bohol. <br><br>
			<h1>Educational Background</h1>
			    I graduated in Booy Main Elementary School in 2010. I finished high school at University of Bohol in 2014. Now currently studying at Cristal-E College and taking up the course of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology Major in Multimedia (BSIT).<br><br>
			<h1>Hobbies</h1>	
				I do have a lot of hobbies, and one of them is dancing. I love to dance because I want to express everything when I'm dancing. Dancing is my life and relieves my stress. 
			<h1>Artworks</h1>
				I had been involved in some project in Multimedia that creates an animation or vector art. I made some portraits of myself, family and friends. You can see it in my <a href="vectorarts.html">artworks</a>.<br><br>
